March Post

3/30/25

I'm frightened by how much we depend in our daily lives on a couple of Big Tech companies. For example, I own an iPhone and a Windows laptop. Without these two devices, I would be hard-pressed to do my daily activities: not just work ones, but even just things like socializing with my peers and scheduling social activities with my family. And well, I could work around not owning these devices; I could go to the public library or a tech cafe (do those even exist in my town?) and just communicate with my family by word of mouth--but that's not very realistic, is it? Society assumes that you have these devices and so tasks at the workplace and relationship activities are now built in such a way that these technologies to participate in them. It does little good to try to be a tech-hermit that uses flip-phones. The niceties and advantages of smart phones are so built-in to our collective lifestyles that we simply cannot do without them. But if we must use this technology, then perhaps we can make it work for us instead of us working for it. However, before I go on to describe my plan for improving my use of electronic technology, I would like to impress how dangerous it is for a society to depend on software and hardware companies. If I buy a car, and the car company is secretly evil and put a bomb inside every model of the cars they sell such that one day, if they wish, they can blow up all the cars by the press of a big red button, then that’s bad. That’s really bad. But if someone were able to find out (say some big-shot heroic journalist) and warn everyone about this then people could just stop using the evilCorp cars and everything would be alright. Now, let’s pretend that the government is under control of car companies and therefore they can’t tell the car companies to stop putting bombs inside cars. Well, what could happen is that all the car companies could just agree to put bombs in their cars and to rule society. But if at least one of them decides not to do it (maybe to take out the competition, idk) then consumers will just start ditching the other cars and buying that company’s cars. My point is that we have options, and options allow us to (potentially) get less screwed over by car companies. With phones, nowadays indispensable like the car, we also have (some) options, although Apple does have over 50% market share of the industry (which is crazy given how little their phones have truly improved in the last couple of years while charging exorbitant prices for their latest [identical to the last] model). But it gets worse with more abstract Tech products:

Search engines? You know, the things that let you actually find websites on the Internet? Two real options Google and Bing

Main points: 

Big Tech companies have consolidated their gains in different spheres of influence in the Technological World. 
Each company has an oligarchical or monopolistic control over the space or spaces it has consolidated
Google with search engines and browsers
Microsoft with operating systems
Apple with smartphones and smart devices
These companies bank on us staying with them despite growing privacy and ethical concerns towards their business practices 
We are lazy (we don’t want to change phones, operating systems, applications)
It’s not feasible for a lot of us (certain tools used at the job, high barrier to entry to explore alternatives ex. changing OS)
Lack of awareness & education about these issues
There’s not much we can do, I think
In the same way that tax companies lobby the government to keep tax laws stupidly complicated, tech companies lobby to keep regulations away
The business model of many of these companies is based on selling ALL our personalized user data, which is collected to be as accurate and comprehensive as possible. We are the product
If tech companies were restricted in their ability to make us into data-products, then they would make significantly less money (I think??) and might make more of their services be under a paywall or just generally increase prices. 
Once there is a monopoly, it’s very difficult to remove it as the monopoly company buys out competitors or is just so far ahead that any would-be rival cannot create a minimum viable product
We need to increase awareness of the ethical concerns that depending on Big Tech companies in our society causes

Search Engines
I have researched extensively (for two days) on search engines and it seems that basically there are three options: Bing, Google, or Brave
There are many other search engines but they all kind of suck for two main reasons: 
1. They require way too much user-tweaking / configuration
2. They give lower-quality search results
Search quality: Google *****, Brave ****, Bing**
This is of course my personal opinion but many other people echo this sentiment. Brave uses its own search index (unlike many other browsers which just 
I don’t know how long Brave will continue to work for free with all its current features (it seems they are increasingly rolling out ads on more of their content and plan to roll out an ads-free experience for premium users in the future)

Web Browsers
With web browsers you have many more realistic options than with search engines, however, the quality of these web browsers is tied to the web engine upon which they are built
Some web browsers depend on Google or another big tech company’s technology in order to work
For example, many popular alternative web browsers use chromium, which while open source, is realistically controlled and owned by Google
This means that Google can decide to change how all web browsers built on chromium work at their whim	
Ex. manifest V2, the technology that a lot of chromium browser extensions rely on, is being removed from chromium
This means all these extensions will no longer be supported from now on or in the near future (unless they update and are approved by Google’s new version of chromium. 
UBlock Origin, a very popular adblocker, is no longer supported with manifest V3 (although it seems some versions of it might still work)

Basically, we are fucked either way. You want good search results? Google. You want privacy? Well, you can use this browser made by this non-profit, but it’s basically owned by Google and uses Google’s search engine, so you’re still probably giving your data to Google. Don’t want to use Google even when it’s hidden behind another company? Sure, use this new browser. It doesn’t use Google’s search engine and it guarantees that your data isn’t stolen. Great! Oh wait… it’s built on top of Chromium, Google’s open source web engine… Well, say bye to all those supported extensions, like your favorite adblock! But wait! There's a way to get maximum security and user customization! You just have to spend 100 hours clicking buttons and testing but oh, yeah, like only 2 websites on the Internet will support your custom browser, and good luck getting it to run faster than a Windows XP computer running Overwatch.


Aside → Philosophy of Language: how can we communicate our ideas fast enough? Writing is certainly the fastest way to communicate thought (IF the writing is condensed and good, otherwise talking is faster). 

To lose the ability to write is a very sad thing. Writing is a skill, and like any skill, it must be trained. I do not use Grammarly or any of these other annoying writing “helper” tools because they get in the way of writing. The mind is already overwhelmed enough by all the ideas one has in one’s head. I do not understand why it randomly flashes.. I do not understand why it suddenly came out and started flashing. Madness enveloped all…

When one is writing for a specific purpose that is when the madness reveals itself. For when one is writing on a whim without any specific goal in thought the mind is permitted to travel freely. What pleasure it is to just say what pleases oneself regardless of whether it makes sense or has any particular purpose. But I am getting ahead of myself… or behind? Or nowhere. Yes, I am getting nowhere. 

Back to Philosophy of the Internet ⇒ 

It sucks that we depend so much on technology nowadays. And, I know how much that makes me sound like a Boomer ranting on and on about the same tired, old point so I won’t go on. But I do want to write about how my relationship to technology has (hopefully) changed and how I’ve become increasingly aware of my position as a Digital Citizen (more on this later). 

The world is ruled by technology. We are immersed in it. Yet we don’t realize how much we depend on it until we don’t have it. For example, one day I was scrolling through Youtube, letting my brain rot, when suddenly I got a notification that due to a new update to the Chrome browser extensions the adblocker would no longer be supported. Suddenly, from one day to the next, I would no longer be able to spend thousands of hours of intellectually-rewarding Youtube shorts without the obtrusive, mind-numbing interruption of non-stop advertisements. I felt like I had been shot in the chest. 

Now, judge me if you will for using ad blockers (that is a discussion for another day), but my point is that I had taken Chrome for granted so much that when it didn’t work absolutely perfectly, it felt like my whole world was coming down. 

We treat the Internet like a supercar, except it’s a supercar that should never fail to start, turns and breaks perfectly, and can read our every thought and emotion. So, when something doesn’t go our way, we panic. But it’s good to have these moments because they make you reflect on your situation. Up until my adblock failed I hadn’t thought about the implications of using Google products until a couple months ago, when I funnily enough was a guinea pig for a web privacy study. 

Improving my habitudes with technology

No more youtube on my phone. I will have to find more intellectually engaging ways to pass the time when I am bored. I can still watch YT on my ipad or PC
