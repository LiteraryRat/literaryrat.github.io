Wait so what happens when I create a sixth post? Here I'm going to write something and see what happens. 

I do wonder if I'll be able to continue writing this after school starts. I really hope so. I enjoy writing whatever's on my mind that's also fun and not sad diary type of content.  Anyway... what to write about...

Well, one thing that I think about a lot is what place writing has in the world. Why do we care about writing? Well, for one thing it is a really good way to decompress. I feel really relaxed when I'm writing. Just me and the paper (or machine) typing away. Another thing about writing is that you can communicate complex thoughts to many more people than you ever could by talking. I just thought about what if people shared books about paintings. Oh wait those already exist: artbooks. And those pretentious photography books about tropical islands that people put on their coffee tables and never actually read. 

I love writing, but for some reason, I don't do it all the time. Isn't that silly? I'm going to try to write on here as much as I can. Man, this keyboard is sticky. Yuck. 

Anyways, hopefully I can come up with a better topic to write about soon. I mean, actually I could start right now. Let me see my list...

Well, I'm not going to go too much into detail, but I feel like it's overly hard to find good modern reading material online. Like, there is stuff out there that I can read but a lot of it is crappy fan fiction (ok some of it is surprisingly good lel) websites. I mean, even then that's besides the point. I want basically a place where I can redirect to all the libraries / bookshops of the online and physical world.  Like I want to be able to go to a site and then from there redirect myself to all the sites that have books I might be interested in. But it's not just books. I want to have sites that have short stories, essays, poems, random thoughts all in one place that I can read. And I want to read stuff output by people my age, not people who are already adults and boring. So yeah. That's kind of one of the main reasons I created this site.
