Ok I want to write about some serious stuff now. I've gotten the hang of writing like this now——I think——and I would like 
to now write things that I really care about. So let's do this. The topic of discussion will be... nah just kidding I'm going to 
be more disorganized than that. Let me write about some things that I want to not forget. 

Life lessons:
  a) The power of habits. You can accomplish so much by creating a habit; it's really how things get done.
  b) You have time to do a lot of stuff. What matters is actually going out there and doing what you want to do.
  c) Do fun stuff. You only live once.
  d) Don't be afraid of loving others. There's no point in running away from emotions and being vulnerable. We all need love.
  e) Mental Health is real. Look at what happened to my birds.
  f) Projects are good. Activities. Goals. Etc. They don't have to be "work".
  g) We're all gonna die. Do the stuff that matters.

Be like this guy. He looks pretty happy with his budgie pals.

So now on to other things. Here are some thing I want to write about on here in future blog posts:

2. Philosophy and how we can use it in modernity.
3. Life as a student. Where I'm headed
4. The Good Life. 
5. What's it worth investing in?
6. Strong cities.
