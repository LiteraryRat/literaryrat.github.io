Let's try to add pictures on a markdown!

![This was supposed to be a picture of a castle](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Panor%C3%A1mica_Oto%C3%B1o_Alc%C3%A1zar_de_Segovia.jpg/1600px-Panor%C3%A1mica_Oto%C3%B1o_Alc%C3%A1zar_de_Segovia.jpg?20190519154610 "A picture!")

*The bird-lord slew him, for he was weak...*

Many warriors have fought and fallen, yet not all who fell have fought. Is it not better to fall fighting? Truly, if it be the fate of all bird and beast to perish, is it not more worthy to beat the red drums of Valhalla in defiance. Krö knew this, and thus she slew even those who surrendered to him after a good fight, for she held defeat in contempt. For her, only when the life-blood was drained out of one's eyes was the fight truly over. KRAA! KRAA! EULËLIAA! KAZUD-KALÁ! The drums of war drum drum! 

Yet this fervent spirit is not limited to war--nay, the crow-lairds host great gatherings for sport, most of which involve great aerial acrobatics. Great rings of painted wood or finely-wrought steel are brought and use for sports that involve flying through them in deadly races or team games where feathered balls must fall through the hoops. Celda: she is the great champion of that last game.
