# In search of truth.

This site is an experiment, a journal, a sandbox. Here I will be exploring a broad range  of ideas. This is a personal blog of sorts and yet because I wish to share it with others (on the off-chance it will inspire them) it must remain anonymous. It must be anonymous because sadly, I need money to live, and I do not wish to jeopardize my employment through anything I might say here. 

But do not think that I do not mean what I say here. Not at all. I very much do mean it, and I stand proudly by what I say. Is this ironic? Perhaps. ALAS!
